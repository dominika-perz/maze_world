# maze_world
A Python 3 portfolio project, which implements several algorithms for maze generation and solving. The aim of the project is to improve my Python programming skills, implement different algorithms, learn about GUI, sending SQl queries from Python program, system design and design patters.

## TODO:
* add docstrings for each class and generator functions
* update the ocumentation
* create GUI to visualise the maze and solving process
* implement algorithms for maze generation
* implement more algorithms for solving the maze

## Possible future improvements:
* Add database with ready mazes and possibility to connect to this DB via GUI
* Add genetic algorithm / reinforment learning solving solution

## Documentation
